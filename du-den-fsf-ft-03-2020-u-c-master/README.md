## Important Links And Notes

#### Review Sessions

Your instructor will hold weekly review sessions on Wednesdays from 3:00pm-4:30pm. These sessions are optional and will typically cover particularly challenging or relevant class activities and concepts. They're a great way to get more practice and in-depth explanation of class material. 

Wednesday review sessions will likely be cancelled during project weeks or when the instructor is absent. 

There will also be occasional review sessions on Friday evenings from 6:30pm-9:30pm. These sessions will be announced in advance, typically both on Bootcamp Spot and by your instructor.
